# Easypost Integration

Easypost is a VTEX IO integration that allows stores to create return labels. This should be used in conjunction with the [returns](https://github.com/vtex-apps/return-app) app for full functionality.

## Configuration
### Step 1 Installing the Easypost Integration app

Using your terminal, log in to the desired VTEX account and run the following command:

`vtex install vtex.easypost@0.x`

### Step 2 - Adding in Easypost Information 

In the admin page, fill in the required fields of Client Key and default return address (where you want returns to be shipped to). This can be accessed from the Easypost website, after creating an account.

## Customization

In order to apply CSS customizations in this and other blocks, follow the instructions given in the recipe on [Using CSS Handles for store customization](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/style/using-css-handles-for-store-customization).
